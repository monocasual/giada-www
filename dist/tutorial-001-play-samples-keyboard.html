</h1><h2>Getting started</h2><p>In this tutorial we are going to use Giada as a sample player by loading samples into channels and binding keyboard buttons to them. So the first thing to do is to find some nice samples to play: a drum kit sample pack can be a good candidate, for example.
</p><h2>Load samples into sample channels</h2><p>Suppose you have a drum audio file, say <em>Kick.wav</em>: select it in the operating system's file browser and drag it over an empty column in Giada. This will create a new sample channel already filled with your sound and ready to play. You can also drag and drop multiple files at once. 
</p><p>Alternatively, you can create an empty sample channel first and then load it with the audio file. Click on the <em>Edit column</em> button on top of any column, then select <em>Add Sample channel</em> from the drop-down menu: a new empty sample channel will appear in the selected column. Now click on the channel main button, highlighted below:
</p><p> <img src="images/tutorials/001/empty-sample-channel.png" alt="An empty sample channel"></p><p>Select <em>Load new sample...</em> from the drop-down menu. A file browser window will appear: select the file you want to load (say <em>Kick.wav</em>) and then click the <em>Load</em> button when you're done. The sample channel will now look like this:
</p><p> <img src="images/tutorials/001/filled-sample-channel.png" alt="A filled sample channel"></p><p>Rinse and repeat for all the samples you want to load. 
</p><h2>Bind channels to keyboard buttons</h2><p>Click on the channel main button again, and select <em>Setup keyboard input...</em>. from the drop-down menu. A new window will pop up:
</p><p> <img src="images/tutorials/001/key-binding-window.png" alt="Keyboard binding window"></p><p>Press the key on your keyboard you want to bind to the selected channel, then click the <em>Close</em> button when done. Click <em>Clear</em> instead to reset the binding. The channel will look like this:
</p><p> <img src="images/tutorials/001/channel-bound.png" alt="Channel bound"></p><p>The keyboard button that has been bound to the channel is displayed next to the sample name. 
</p><h2>Select the right sample channel mode</h2><p>You are now ready to launch samples by pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard. New sample channels have the play mode set to <em>One-shot basic</em> by default, as seen in the picture below:
</p><p><img src="images/tutorials/001/sample-channel-mode.png" alt="Sample Channel mode"></p><p>This mode allows you to trigger a sample as soon as the bound key is pressed. You may also want to experiment with other <em>single shot</em> modes, by clicking the button outlined in the picture above and select an option from the drop-down menu. For example:
</p><ul><li><p><em>One-shot press</em> — the channel plays as long as its key is pressed;</p></li><li><p><em>One-shot retrig</em> — the first keypress starts the channel; a second keypress (while playing) rewinds it. Perfect fit for drumming;</p></li><li><p><em>One-shot endless</em> — the channel plays in loop forever; pressing its key stops it. Good for layering up multiple sounds.</p></li></ul><h2>See also</h2><ul><li><a href="/documentation-performing-1">Documentation: Channel and Samples</a></li><li><a href="/documentation-channels-and-samples">Documentation: Performing, part 1</a></li></ul></section><footer><div class="about"><p>Giada is developed by<br><a href="http://www.monocasual.com"><img src="images/monocasual-logo.svg" alt="monocasual laboratories"></a></p></div><div class="vst"><p>VST Plug-In Technology by Steinberg.<br>VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.</p></div><div class="links"><p><a href="privacy">privacy policy </a> | <a href="tos">terms of service </a></p></div></footer><script type="module" src="js/main-2.0.3.js"></script></body></html>
