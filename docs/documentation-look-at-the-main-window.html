</h1><p><img src="images/docs/main-window.png" alt="Main Window"></p><p>The main window is the part of Giada where you will spend most of the time while live playing. The upper part contains the main menu and several tools for input/output, tempo management and global synchronization. The remaining space is for <strong>columns</strong> and <strong>channels</strong>. 
</p><p>Don't worry if you don't understand the behavior of these elements right now; they will be covered more clearly in the next chapters. Let's take a quick glance at the several components that make up the main interface, starting from the main area.
</p><h2>Columns and channels</h2><p>Columns contain channels, which in turn hold audio samples or MIDI events. Channels are one of the building blocks of Giada and that's where the sound comes from â€” mostly. Their usage will be covered in <a href="/documentation-performing-1">Performing part 1</a>, <a href="/documentation-performing-2">Performing part 2</a>, <a href="/documentation-channels-and-samples">Channels and samples</a> and <a href="/documentation-channels-and-midi">Channels and MIDI</a> chapters.
</p><p>You can add as many channels and columns as you want. Columns are used to organize your project and arrange channels according to some logic. For example, you can group drum kits on column 1 and pads on column 2, while voice loops live in column 3. Each column contains a special channel, the column channel, that controls the audio and MIDI signals of all the channels that belong to that column.
</p><h2>Main input and main output</h2><p>These tools take care of audio I/O: input on the left, ouput on the right. The circular knobs control the volume, the vertical bars are meters. Ranging from -60 to 0 dBFS, when a bar is completely full it means that you are recording or playing at the maximum level allowed. If you exceed this limit your sound starts to clip and the meter turns red.</p><p>The button located below the input meter is the <strong>stream linker</strong> <img class="inline" src="images/docs/stream-linker-button.png" alt="Stream Linker button">. If enabled, it copies the input audio straight to the output channel, in order to obtain a "hear what you're playing" functionality. The <img class="inline" src="images/docs/fx-button.png" alt="FX"> buttons are used to load audio plug-ins both for the input and the output channel. More information in the <a href="/documentation-audio-plugins">Audio Plugins</a> chapter.
</p><h2>The sequencer and the main transport</h2><p><strong>The sequencer</strong> is a central tool in Giada. It keeps your live performance in sync and is responsible for driving loops, samples and MIDI events. It is managed by the <strong>main transport</strong>, namely the <strong>play/stop</strong> button that starts and stops the song and the <strong>rewind</strong> button that quickly rewinds the sequencer to the first beat. 
</p><p>The main transport features additional elements such as the recording buttons (second group from the left), used to 
toggle <strong>audio recording</strong> and <strong>action recording</strong>. More information in the <a href="/documentation-recording-actions">Recording Actions</a> and <a href="/documentation-live-sampling">Live sampling</a> chapters. The last button is the <strong>metronome</strong>, useful during a recording session.
</p><h2>Beats, bars, quantizer and BPM</h2><p><img src="images/docs/beats-tools.png" alt="Beats tools"></p><p>A set of tools responsible for beats and tempo management. You can find them grouped in the top right area of the main window. From left to right, the <strong>Quantizer</strong> aligns the samples on beats and on exact fractions of beats. It works only when the main sequencer is running. More information in the <a href="/documentation-performing-1">Performing part 1</a> chapter; The <strong>BPM button</strong> changes the speed of your performance; the <strong>Beats/bars button</strong> changes the number of beats and bars of the main sequencer; the <strong>Beat operators</strong> (last two buttons on the right) dynamically shrink or expand the the total number of beats of the main sequencer.</p></section><footer><div class="about"><p>Giada is developed by<br><a href="http://www.monocasual.com"><img src="images/monocasual-logo.svg" alt="monocasual laboratories"></a></p></div><div class="vst"><p>VST Plug-In Technology by Steinberg.<br>VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.</p></div><div class="links"><p><a href="privacy">privacy policy </a> | <a href="tos">terms of service </a></p></div></footer><script type="module" src="js/main-2.0.3.js"></script></body></html>
