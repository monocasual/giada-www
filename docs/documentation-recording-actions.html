</h1><p>An <strong>action</strong> is something you do on a channel. First of all Giada must be put in <em>action recording mode</em> by clicking on the <strong>record actions button</strong> <img class="inline" src="images/docs/action-recorder-button.png" alt="Action recorder button"> in the main transport or by pressing the <span class="code">enter</span> key: now Giada will record any gesture coming from your mouse+keyboard and/or MIDI controllers.
</p><h2>Actions for sample channels</h2><p>On a sample channel you can record the following:</p><ul><li>key press;</li><li>key release;</li><li>sample kill.</li></ul><p>Once Giada is in action recording mode, sample channels available and ready for receiving actions will turn <em>red</em>. When you're done, disable the action recording mode by clicking on the record actions button a second time: any sample channel with something recorded in it will have the <strong>read actions button</strong> <img class="inline" src="images/docs/read-recs-button.png" alt="Read recordings button"> enabled: if pressed, actions recorded for this channel will be reproduced.</p><p>If you need to remove all actions from a sample channel, click on the channel main button and select <em>Clear actions</em> from the drop-down menu, or tweak them more thoroughly with the <a href="documentation-action-editor">Action Editor</a>.
</p><h2>Actions for MIDI channels</h2><p>On MIDI channels you can record any type of MIDI event supported by the <a href="documentation-action-editor">Piano Roll Editor</a>. First of all press the <strong>arm button</strong> <img class="inline" src="images/docs/arm-button.png" alt="Arm button">, then enable the action recording mode and start your performance with your MIDI controller. When you're done, disable the action recording mode by clicking on the record actions button a second time.</p><p>If you need to remove all actions from a MIDI channel, click on the channel main button and select <em>Clear actions</em> from the drop-down menu, or tweak them more thoroughly with the <a href="documentation-action-editor">Action Editor</a>.
</p><h2>Live effects processor</h2><p>You can also arm one or more MIDI channels without triggering the action recording mode. This way Giada turns into a live effects processor, driven by your MIDI notes received in input. This is very useful when you want to live play your virtual instruments through a MIDI controller.
</p><h2>Record on signal</h2><p>Pressing the record actions button will also start the sequencer. Sometimes you want it to wait instead and start when the first action is received. This mode is called <strong>record on signal</strong> and you can enable it by clicking on the <strong>record on signal button</strong> <img class="inline" src="images/docs/record-on-signal-button.png" alt="Record on signal button"> located on the main transport.</p></section><footer><div class="about"><p>Giada is developed by<br><a href="http://www.monocasual.com"><img src="images/monocasual-logo.svg" alt="monocasual laboratories"></a></p></div><div class="vst"><p>VST Plug-In Technology by Steinberg.<br>VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.</p></div><div class="links"><p><a href="privacy">privacy policy </a> | <a href="tos">terms of service </a></p></div></footer><script type="module" src="js/main-2.0.3.js"></script></body></html>
