				h1 Compiling from source
				p
					| This chapter is about compiling the code inside the tar.gz you download from this site. If you are trying to compile the code downloaded/cloned from GitHub, take a look 
					a(href='documentation-development-git-setup') here
					| .
				p
					| Compiling Giada from source requires a C++14-compatible compiler. The configure script inside the package, designed for Unix systems and MinGW (Windows) will help you to guess correct values for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. You have to pass it the 
					span.code --target
					|  parameter depending on your operating system:
				p.code
					| ./configure --target=[linux | osx | windows]
				p
					| e.g. if you want to compile for Linux, do:
				p.code
					| ./configure --target=linux
				p
					| When the script is done without errors, do:
				p.code
					| make
				p
					| to compile everything. If you wish to install Giada on Linux, become root and type
				p.code
					| make install
				p
					| to copy the binary file into /usr/local/bin path.
				p
					| Optionally, if you want to run the test suite, just do:
				p.code
					| make check
				p
					| All unit tests are based on #[a(href='https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/') Catch automated test framework], which supports several command-line options. Please take a look at the #[a(href='https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/command-line.md') official documentation] to understand the gritty details. The command above will just run the entire test suite.
				
				h3 Additional flags
				p
					|
					span.code --enable-debug
					|  — enable debug mode (mainly asserts). It is disabled by default;

				p
					|
					span.code --enable-system-catch
					|  — by default Giada includes Catch from the local source folder. Pass this flag to use the system provided one instead (useful in most Linux distributions);

				h2 Dependencies
				p
					| Giada is based upon several external libraries, plus a custom version of RtAudio shipped with the source package. Our hacked RtAudio provides Jack Transport support on Linux, a feature that you wouldn't find in the vanilla release. At the present moment we suggest you to use the following versions:
				ul
					li FLTK — 1.3.[0 or greater];
					li Libsndfile — 1.0.28 or greater;
					li Libsamplerate — 0.1.9 or greater;
					li Jansson — 2.9 or greater;
					li RtMidi — 3.0.0 or greater;
					li (optional, for VST) JUCE 5.3.2. 

				h2 How to enable VST support
				p
						| In order to compile Giada with VST support you have to enable the feature via configure script. Add the following parameter:
				p.code
						| --enable-vst
				p
						| e.g. if you want to compile for Linux with VST support, do:
				p.code
						| ./configure --target=linux --enable-vst

				h3 Add JUCE framework
				p
					| Steinberg has deprecated VST 2, but our source code still depends on it. We are working to add full VST 3 support in the very near future. For now we rely on a specific JUCE version (5.3.2) that still contains VST 2 SDK headers. #[a(href="https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE/releases/tag/5.3.2") Go grab it from GitHub] and drop the #[span.code module/] folder inside #[span.code giada-src-folder/src/deps/juce]. Then start the compilation as usual.

				h2 Use the official Docker image for Giada
				p
					| Instead of cluttering up your environment with dependencies, scripts and compilers you may try our 
					a(href='https://hub.docker.com/u/monocasual/') Docker image
					| , designed to ease the compilation and testing processes. Take a look at the 
					a(href='https://github.com/monocasual/giada-docker') GitHub repository
					|  to know more.
