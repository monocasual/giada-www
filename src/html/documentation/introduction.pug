		h2 Warnings

		p.
			Giada is still in a beta stage of development and may lack of some functionalities which could make it hard to use. Please see the #[a(href='https://github.com/monocasual/giada/milestones') milestones] to understand the direction of development. Giada is obviously full of bugs, too. So you are welcome to join our #[a(href='https://github.com/monocasual/giada/discussions') forum] and submit any malfunction or suggestion.
		p.
			If you want to collaborate with this project, join us on #[a(href='https://github.com/monocasual/giada') GitHub].
		
		h2 Requirements

		p.
			We distribute Giada as 64-bit binary files for Windows, macOS and Linux. more specifically:

		ul
			li
				p on Windows — Windows Vista or greater is required;
			li
				p on macOS — macOS Sierra 10.14 or greater is required;
			li
				p.
					on Linux — Giada is packaged as an #[a(href='https://appimage.org/') AppImage] and can run on many distributions (including Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, elementaryOS, Linux Mint, and others). What you need: 
				ul
					li 
						p glibc version 2.23 or greater;
					li
						p libstdc++ version 3.4.21 or greater;
					li
						p JACK installed.
		
		p.
			You can also build Giada from source. More information in the #[a(href='/documentation-compiling-from-source') Compiling from source] page.

		h2 How to run Giada

		p.
			Go to the #[a(href='/index#download') Download area], grab the package for your operating system, unzip it if required. Then:
		ul
			li
				p on Windows and macOS — Double-click on the program icon to start Giada;
			li
				p.
					on Linux — Mark the .AppImage file you have downloaded as #[em executable]. For example, on the command line:
				p.code.
					chmod +x Giada-1.0.0-x86_64.AppImage
				p.
					Now double-click on the .AppImage file to start Giada. 

		h2 The configuration file

		p.
			Giada saves its configuration in a file called #[span.code giada.conf], generated somewhere in your filesystem:
		ul
			li
				p.
					Linux — #[span.code /home/(your_user)/.giada/giada.conf];
			li
				p.
					macOS — #[span.code (your_home)/Library/Application Support/Giada/giada.conf];
			li 
				p.
					Windows — in the same folder of the binary file.
		p.
			If you accidentally delete or alter it, the default setup will be used. This file is restored the next time you quit the program.

		h2 Problems with the Linux version?

		p.
			The AppImage package that you can download from this website should just work out of the box. However for the absolute, best, top-notch experience you should also try binaries shipped by the package manager of your favorite distribution. Giada is available on #[a(href='https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=giada&searchon=names&section=all') Debian], #[a(href='https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?section=all&arch=any&keywords=giada&searchon=names') Ubuntu] and many more.

		h2 Problems with the macOS version?

		p.
			The macOS package we currently provide is not signed, which makes the OS quite unhappy. So if Giada doesn't start when double-clicked, try to remove the "quarantine flag" by running #[a(href='https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/372208') these instructions]. Additionaly, macOS Gatekeeper might get in the way: follow #[a(href='https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/') these instructions] to disable it.
