			User guide<br>Live sampling.

		p.
			Giada gives you the ability to record anything coming in from your soundcard thanks to its live sampler and the master input channel. Configure your device in the #[a(href='documentation-configuration') Configuration panel] first, then turn up the knob of the #[strong input volume] #[img(src='images/docs/gui_inputmeter.png' alt='The input peakmeter' class='inline')] in the main window.

		h2 How to use the live sampler

		p.
			The live sampler works only with sample channels. Add at least one sample channel, then arm it with the channel #[strong arm button] #[img(src='images/docs/arm-button.png' alt='Arm button' class='inline')]. You can of course arm multiple channels. When you are ready, click on the #[strong audio recording button] #[img(src='images/docs/input-recording-button.png' alt='audio recording button' class='inline')] located on the main transport or press the #[span.code end] key to enable the sampler: channels with active input will turn #[em blue].
		p.
			The sequencer will start automatically, since recording audio with the sequencer turned off doesn't make sense. The sampler works in #[em overdub mode] by default: data coming from the soundcard is being continuously summed to the existing audio until the sampler is halted.

		h2 Live effects processor

		p.
			Arm the channel and check the #[strong input monitor] flag in channel drop-down menu. This way you will hear what you're actually playing, previously processed by the plugins stack (if any). If you don't enable the sampler (#[strong input recording button] #[img(src='images/docs/input-recording-button.png' alt='Input recording button' class='inline')] or #[span.code end] key), Giada won't record anything and turns itself into a live effects processor.
		p.
			You can accomplish the same result by using the #[strong stream linker], the button between the input and the output meter #[img(src='images/docs/input-output-linker.png' alt='Input to output linker' class='inline')] located on the main window. Enable it and you will be able to hear what you're playing.

		h2 Record on signal

		p.
			Pressing the audio recording button will also start the sequencer. Sometimes you want it to wait instead and start when the audio level in input reaches a certain threshold. This mode is called #[strong record on signal] and you can enable it by clicking on the #[strong record on signal button] #[img(src='images/docs/record-on-signal-button.png' alt='Record on signal button' class='inline')] located on the main transport. You can set the desired threshold level in the #[a(href='documentation-configuration') Configuration panel].
