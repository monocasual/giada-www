				h1 Recording actions

				p. 
					An #[strong action] is something you do on a channel. First of all Giada must be put in #[em action recording mode] by clicking on the #[strong record actions button] #[img.inline(src='images/docs/action-recorder-button.png' alt='Action recorder button')] in the main transport or by pressing the #[span.code enter] key: now Giada will record any gesture coming from your mouse+keyboard and/or MIDI controllers.

				h2 Actions for sample channels

				p.
					On a sample channel you can record the following:
				ul
					li key press;
					li key release;
					li sample kill.

				p.
					Once Giada is in action recording mode, sample channels available and ready for receiving actions will turn #[em red]. When you're done, disable the action recording mode by clicking on the record actions button a second time: any sample channel with something recorded in it will have the #[strong read actions button] #[img.inline(src='images/docs/read-recs-button.png' alt='Read recordings button')] enabled: if pressed, actions recorded for this channel will be reproduced.
				p.
					If you need to remove all actions from a sample channel, click on the channel main button and select #[em Clear actions] from the drop-down menu, or tweak them more thoroughly with the #[a(href='documentation-action-editor') Action Editor].

				h2 Actions for MIDI channels

				p.
					On MIDI channels you can record any type of MIDI event supported by the #[a(href='documentation-action-editor') Piano Roll Editor]. First of all press the #[strong arm button] #[img.inline(src='images/docs/arm-button.png' alt='Arm button')], then enable the action recording mode and start your performance with your MIDI controller. When you're done, disable the action recording mode by clicking on the record actions button a second time.
				p.
					If you need to remove all actions from a MIDI channel, click on the channel main button and select #[em Clear actions] from the drop-down menu, or tweak them more thoroughly with the #[a(href='documentation-action-editor') Action Editor].

				h3 Live effects processor

				p.
					You can also arm one or more MIDI channels without triggering the action recording mode. This way Giada turns into a live effects processor, driven by your MIDI notes received in input. This is very useful when you want to live play your virtual instruments through a MIDI controller.
				
				h2 Record on signal

				p.
					Pressing the record actions button will also start the sequencer. Sometimes you want it to wait instead and start when the first action is received. This mode is called #[strong record on signal] and you can enable it by clicking on the #[strong record on signal button] #[img.inline(src='images/docs/record-on-signal-button.png' alt='Record on signal button')] located on the main transport.
